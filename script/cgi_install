=head1 NAME

cgi_install - Command line script for installing web applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cgi_install My::WebApp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<cgi_install> is a command line tool for installing web applications that
come with L<Module::CGI::Install>-based install classes.

The B<cgi_install> application takes a single parameter of the class name
of the application to install (the application itself must implement support
for Module::CGI::Install).

The application will be told by the CGI application what it needs to install.

Once the web application has told the installer what needs to be installed,
the installer will ask a series of questions, and check the results.

Primarily, it will ask for a local path to the CGI directory to install to,
and the matching URI (this will then be tested) and in some cases a static
non-cgi path to install images and other static content to, and a matching
URI for that as well.

Once the paths have been verified, the files will be installed and set to
the appropriate permissions (based on the data from the CGI environment
that was captured while validating the CGI path) and then the application
is considered "installed", at which time you can point your browser at the
final URI provided to you.
