NAME
    Module::CGI::Install - Installer for CGI applications

DESCRIPTION
    Module::CGI::Install is a package for installing CGI applications.

    It is based on the principle that a particular application may need to
    be installed multiple times on a single host.

    So an application can be installed normally onto the system, and from
    there the functionality provided by Module::CGI::Install creates a way
    to

    quickly, easily and safely move a copy of that application (or at least
    the parts that matter) from the default system install location to the
    specific CGI directory.

  Intended for CGI Application Authors
    The API described below is primarily for the benefit of CGI application
    authors.

    End-users looking to actually install the applications should be using
    the cgiinstall command line tool.
